# Companion-Robot-For-Elderly
This is a final year project developed by <b>Benedict Tan Zhi Hang</b> and <b>Lai Liang Chun</b>.
<br/>
<p align="justify"> The care of aging parents/grandparents is something that we will be balancing along with working full-time jobs and other issues. It is natural when the family members feel the need to constantly check on their elderly parents/grandparents even when they live a great distance away from them. The care for them is more necessary than ever, especially when they are diagnosed with diseases such as Alzheimer. Caregiving from a far distance comes with many problems and challenges. Therefore, the companion robot for elderly is introduced.  </p>
